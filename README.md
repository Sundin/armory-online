### Customize configuration

## Backend

The comments and vote APIs are built using the `x-amazon-apigateway-integration` extension. This means that we can read from and write to DynamoDB without needing a lambda or web service. Instead we will just use an API Gateway as a proxy directly in front of DynamoDB.

### Prerequisites
* Install [aws](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/install-cliv1.html) or [aws2](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/install-cliv2.html) CLI tool.
* Install [sam](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/serverless-application-model/latest/developerguide/serverless-sam-cli-install.html) CLI tool.
* Make sure the bucket `armory-online` exists.
* Make sure you have configured your AWS credentials locally (`aws_access_key_id` and `aws_secret_access_key` in `~/.aws/credentials`).
