Greetings from afar! Unfortunately we have some bad news this time. We are forced to go back into stasis due to the widespread panicking of Earth politicians when they heard about our imminent arrival. Don't be alarmed though, as our ship computer will continue to plan for new landing sites. Stay alive out there and we will see you soon!
