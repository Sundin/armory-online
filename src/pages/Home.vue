    <h3>Music Video</h3>
    <p>
      2018-10-04: Our first music video is out now! The song is "Vault Seven" from our latest album "The Search", out now through High Roller Records.
      The video was directed by the mighty Jim Nederg√•rd and is a dark story about invisable enemies, paranoia and the dangerous power of knowledge.
