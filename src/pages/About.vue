    <h1>About Armory</h1>
    <p>Hyper Speed Metal from Hisingen Island in Gothenburg, Sweden.</p>

      Armory started out in 2012 and has been delivering hyper speed metal since. After two demos,
      the debut full length album
      <span class="title">World Peace… Cosmic War</span>
      was released via High Roller Records in 2016. The album got great reviews from all around the
      world and was priced “Album of the year” by Metal Invader. The band then got to share the
      stage with bigger bands such as Pentagram and Nifelheim. With all the new experience the band
      went into the studio again in late 2017 to record their second album.
      <span class="title">The Search</span> was released in July 2018 via High Roller and again the
      album got great reviews and it was proved that the songwriting had developed in the right
      direction. The band was also able to break new ground outside of Sweden with gigs in Germany,
      Belgium and Denmark. Ratings from live reviews started to get higher and fact is that Armory
      was the only band that got 5/5 on the Metal Magic Festival by the zine Blastbeast.dk. With two
      albums done, Armory was finally ready to make something that they had planned for years but
      previously didn't feel they were ready for: a full blown sci-fi concept album with a story
      from start to finish. This didn't just put more pressure on the lyrics but also to make the
      music more dramatic to fit the story. The resulting album takes the listener through a
      dramatic journey aboard the starship <span class="title">Mercurion</span>, named after the god
      Mercurius – the winged messenger of the gods, protector of travelers and god of boundaries
      between worlds. <span class="title">Mercurion</span> was released in 2022 by the mighty Dying
      Victims Productions.
