    <p>The Space Marauders was the now disbanded Armory fanclub.</p>

    <p>
      Each year a unique gift was distributed to all the fanclub members, such as special edition
      t-shirt and patches, and of course the now highly sought-after "Live in the Abyss" live
      cassette. In this image you can see some of the gifts we have sent out to our faithful fanclub
      members over the years:
