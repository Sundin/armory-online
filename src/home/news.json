This means that no more yearly fanclub gifts will be produced, although all past members may still retain their honorary membership and continue to call themselves Space Marauders. The reason comes down to the simple economical facts of declining membership numbers combined with difficulties in coming up with new ideas for fanclub gifts that are possible to produce in sufficiently low numbers. We thank you all for all these years of support, Space Marauders! All other operations will of course continue like before and we are now focusing all our efforts on finalizing the next Armory album. Keep your eyes to the skies, Marauders!"
